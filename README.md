# UBCx - How to Code: Simple Data [![Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) ![Last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/ozervesh/UBCx-HtCx)

* I audited UBCx's "How to Code: Simple Data" (HtC1x) via edX from December 21, 2021 to April 3, 2022 as part of OSSU's Core Programming requirement (1/8).
* Practice problems from tutorials were completed for every chapter except 5b and 6.
* I'd taken HtC1x concurrently with MIT's "Calculus 1A: Differentiation" (18.01.1x). Work on 18.01.1x was mostly done in the day while I was in camp with no access to computers, while work on HtC1x was mostly done at night after I returned home.
* My notes for this course can be accessed [here](https://ozervesh.notion.site/How-to-Code-Simple-Data-2e49d8ffe2e24b4a90c3df248447e9e0).
