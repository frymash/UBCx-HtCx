; Exercise 1. Add the following definitions for x and y to DrRacketâ€™s definitions area:
; (define x 3)
; (define y 4)
; Now imagine that x and y are the coordinates of a Cartesian point.
; Write down an expression that computes the distance of this point to
; the origin, that is, a point with the coordinates (0,0).
; The expected result for these values is 5, but your expression should
; produce the correct result even after you change these definitions.

(define x 3)
(define y 4)

; Calculate distance between origin (0,0) and the defined point (3,4)
(sqrt (+ (sqr x) (sqr y)))
